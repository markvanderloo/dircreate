Title: Drop-in Replacement for Base R 'dir.create'
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Mark van der Loo

Description: A call to 'dir.create(...,recursive=TRUE)' may fail on Windows
    network drives when the user has no write permissions on each level of the 
    directory tree. This package exports a 'dir.create' that more carefully checks
    which directories actually need to be created.
